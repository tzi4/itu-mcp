# ITU MCP + PaperBridge

ITU MCP + PaperBridge is an MCP server that connects your AI assistant to the
digital services of Istanbul Technical University that you can sign in to with your
ITU email and password, your student number and your library PIN. These include
Ninova, Kepler (OBS), Portal, ITU Mail, the help desk and the library, as well as
publisher sites where ITU's subscriptions let you read and download papers. It runs
on your own computer or server.

This project is a fork of [ITU MCP](https://github.com/yatuk/itu-mcp) by
[yatuk](https://github.com/yatuk), which I've also contributed to. ITU MCP itself
builds on [Ninova MCP](https://github.com/hikmedit/ninova-mcp) by
[Hikmet Gultekin](https://github.com/hikmedit).

Both earlier projects are great if you mainly want to read your ITU data. This fork
adds three things that neither of them offers:

1. **Write actions.** Ninova MCP is read-only, and ITU MCP offers a few write actions
   to local clients only. Here your assistant can submit an assignment, send an email,
   reply on a Ninova message board, open a help ticket and save an OBS registration
   draft, whether the server runs on your computer or on your own server, with
   whichever assistant you use. Every write action asks for your explicit
   confirmation first.
2. **PaperBridge.** Your assistant can read papers behind publisher paywalls through
   your own university access, not only open-access papers.
3. **A router that saves tokens and time.** Both earlier projects list each
   operation as its own tool; ITU MCP lets you switch whole groups off. Here, instead
   of loading all 119 tool definitions into every conversation, the 85 read-only
   operations are reached through one compact tool, so your assistant sees 36 tools.
   In my tests, this server's share of the first prompt dropped to less than half,
   the model picked the right operation more reliably, and several long, multi-step
   requests finished noticeably faster. The router is still evolving.

   <details>
   <summary>Benchmark</summary>

   **ChatGPT, High effort.** 18 real questions about my own account, one fresh chat
   each, through my remote server.

   | | Every tool | Router |
   |---|---|---|
   | Right operation | 17/18 | 18/18 |
   | Median time | 24.5 s | 25.5 s |
   | Exam calendar, a multi-step question | 96 s | 14 s |
   | Attendance check, a multi-step question | 78 s | 38 s |

   Simple one-tool questions took a few seconds longer with the router. ChatGPT
   does not report token use, so I measured tokens in Claude Code with `claude -p`
   ([script](benchmarks/tool_routing/run_claude.py), Haiku 5.5, high effort): the
   router cut this server's share of the first prompt from about 24k to about 10k
   tokens and the total input of all 18 questions by 19%. Claude Code's own tool
   search does even better there (41% fewer tokens, with every tool), so in Claude
   Code use the full list: `ITU_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full`.

   </details>

### Why write actions?

Uploading a finished assignment to Ninova or updating your registration draft
usually means signing in to another site and clicking through it.
Here you ask your assistant instead. It prepares the action, shows you exactly what
will happen and acts only after you confirm, then reports the result so you can
check it.

The same goes for email: your assistant can search your whole ITU mailbox, draft a
message, a reply or a forward, for example to an instructor, with attachments, and send it
after you approve the preview, or save it to your Drafts folder so you can finish it in
webmail. It can also open an ITU help ticket for you: it finds the right unit
and category, fills in the form and submits it once you approve.

### Why PaperBridge?

When you ask ChatGPT, Claude or another assistant to research a topic, it can read
open papers. Most peer-reviewed articles, however, sit behind a paywall. As ITU
students we can read many of them through the university's subscriptions by signing
in with our ITU account. PaperBridge brings that access to your assistant: it
retrieves a paper you are allowed to read through your own institutional access, so
your assistant can read and explain its full text, equations and figures. It
works with IEEE Xplore and Springer Nature Link, and through ITU's OpenAthens login
with ASME and Cambridge Core too.

### Why a separate fork?

I contributed to ITU MCP and still do. Some design choices here differ from the
original project, such as offering write actions, so I continue them in this fork.
You can switch write actions off here. If PaperBridge or the router don't interest
you, or you want a strictly read-only server, have a look at
[ITU MCP](https://github.com/yatuk/itu-mcp) and
[Ninova MCP](https://github.com/hikmedit/ninova-mcp) too. This fork keeps the
original Git history, MIT license and attribution.

## What can you ask?

You ask your assistant in plain language; it fetches the real data from ITU over
the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and answers. Without
a login, the public tools still work: course and final exam schedules, building
codes, shuttles, sports facilities, announcements and the library catalog. The
first rows below are what this fork adds.

| What you ask | What the server does |
|:---|---|
| "Research this topic. Through ITU MCP + PaperBridge, also go through IEEE Xplore, Springer and the publishers I can reach through ITU's OpenAthens, find the papers that aren't openly available and include them in your research." | Paper search, DOI lookup and full-text retrieval through your own university access |
| "Scan Ninova for new assignments, download the files, work through the questions and show me a draft. Upload the reviewed file after I confirm." | Assignment discovery, file download and submission; uploads need your confirmation |
| "Reply to my instructor's last email, attach my report and show me before sending." | A previewed reply, sent or saved to Drafts only after you approve it |
| "Answer the question on my course's message board, but show me first." | Ninova message board threads and a reply posted only after you approve it |
| "My VPN won't connect. Open a help ticket with this screenshot." | Help desk unit, category and form fields, submitted after you approve |
| "Find the emails from my Linear Algebra course two years ago." | Search across the inbox and sent folder |
| "Put my classes, finals and assignment deadlines in my phone's calendar." | One .ics file with weekly classes, exams and deadlines |
| "Which MAT 201E section has the better-rated instructor?" | Public sections with anonymous student ratings from notkutusu.com HocaMetre |
| "Which assignments are due this week? Any new announcements?" | Ninova assignments, due dates and announcements |
| "Grades or attendance for course X? My transcript or advisor?" | Ninova and OBS grades, attendance, profile, advisor and transcript PDF |
| "Read my latest emails, tell me which ones matter, and summarize their attachments." | ITU Mail reading and PDF/JPEG/PNG attachment inspection |
| "When is my final? Are there open seats?" | Public final exam and course schedule tools |
| "What's for lunch, what's my card balance, when is the next shuttle?" | ITU Portal and campus service tools |

These are requests you can give your AI assistant. ITU MCP provides the university
data and tools; your assistant connects the steps, drafts answers and explains
what it finds. File creation and image understanding depend on your AI client.
For submissions, review the final file and confirm the exact upload. Remote
submissions also need the reviewed file staged in the server's managed upload
folder.

OBS responses can differ between accounts. When results are incomplete, the tools
say so. Verify important academic decisions in the OBS interface itself.

## What does PaperBridge add?

<p align="center"><img src="docs/paperbridge-bridge.png" alt="A bridge made of paper" width="720"></p>

I've added PaperBridge for searching academic sources, resolving DOIs, reading
full text I have permission to access, and viewing PDF pages as images. **It
runs in the same process as ITU MCP, so it needs no second MCP connection and no
LLM API key.**

| Source | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Crossref | Search for article titles, authors, DOIs and bibliographic metadata |
| Unpaywall | Open-access link discovery once you configure your own contact email |
| IEEE Xplore | Experimental full-text retrieval through a configured browser, with your own institutional access and a permission record |
| Springer Nature Link | Experimental article and book chapter retrieval under the same conditions |
| ITU OpenAthens | ASME Digital Collection and Cambridge Core, signing in with your library account; ACS, Oxford Academic, Taylor & Francis, SAGE and ACM are tried but often stop at a verification page |
| Your own archive | Texts and PDF pages with a permission record, plus local search |

ScienceDirect, Wiley and several other publishers show automated browsers a
verification page, so PaperBridge cannot read them yet; it reports that instead of
trying to get around the check.
Finding the metadata of an article does not mean reading the full article. For
new sources that have an open-access link, use regular web access. PaperBridge
does not start an institutional login or a new PDF download for such sources.

PaperBridge ships with the package, and its research tools are available by
default. The publisher browser and institutional login stay off until you
configure them. Installation does not download a browser or grant permission for
any document. Tool use and page attachments have been verified in ChatGPT. In
Claude and other MCP clients, the core tools work over standard MCP, while page
attachments and automatic continuation depend on client support. See
[PaperBridge setup](docs/paperbridge.md) for details.

## Use cases

### A morning briefing from my server

I run ITU MCP + PaperBridge on my Raspberry Pi, connect it to ChatGPT, and use
a scheduled task for a morning briefing. Instead of checking several sites, I
get my classes for the day, the lunch menu, upcoming assignment deadlines and
the important messages in my inbox together:

> "You have two classes today. Here's today's lunch menu. An assignment is due
> in two days. Six new emails arrived; two need your attention."

Here is a real English briefing from my phone. It brings together priorities,
mail attachment summaries, course updates and the campus menu. Tap any screenshot
to read it at full size.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="25%" align="center"><a href="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-priorities.jpg"><img src="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-priorities.jpg" alt="My ChatGPT morning briefing: priorities and deadlines" width="230"></a><br><sub>Priorities and deadlines</sub></td>
    <td width="25%" align="center"><a href="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-mail.jpg"><img src="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-mail.jpg" alt="My ChatGPT morning briefing: mail and attachments" width="230"></a><br><sub>Mail and attachments</sub></td>
    <td width="25%" align="center"><a href="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-courses.jpg"><img src="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-courses.jpg" alt="My ChatGPT morning briefing: ninova and obs" width="230"></a><br><sub>Ninova and OBS</sub></td>
    <td width="25%" align="center"><a href="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-today.jpg"><img src="docs/screenshots/morning-briefing-today.jpg" alt="My ChatGPT morning briefing: today on campus" width="230"></a><br><sub>Today on campus</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This example shows my configured setup. The briefing includes
source limitations and incomplete checks; available tools and results depend on
your own configuration and account.

With the server running, I can also open my AI app on my phone and ask a question
while my computer is off. I can check a deadline, read a course file, work through
an assignment or ask PaperBridge about a paper wherever I have a connection.
When submission is configured and my reviewed file is ready in the upload folder,
I can confirm its upload from the same conversation.

For me, an always-on server is the most convenient setup: my phone is already
with me, and I don't need to start my computer first. Scheduling comes from my
AI app or a separate automation setup; ITU MCP supplies the data and tools.

### The same tools while your computer is on

You can also run the server on your own computer and connect a desktop AI client.
While the computer and server are running, ask about your courses, read mail
attachments, review assignments and explore papers in the same conversation.
With remote HTTPS access configured, a compatible AI app on your phone can
connect to that computer too.

Both setups use the same university and research tools; an always-on server only
adds availability while your computer is off.

## Quick start

I've reduced installing to one command: it installs this fork from GitHub and sets
it up. It installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you don't have it, and uv
fetches a suitable Python when needed.

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzi4/itu-mcp-paperbridge/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzi4/itu-mcp-paperbridge/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex"
```

At the end it asks for your ITU login, with the password hidden, and keeps it in a
private file on your computer (`~/.itu-mcp/.env`), never in a client config. Then
it offers to add the server to the AI apps it finds on your computer, and prints
the `claude mcp add` command for Claude Code. Leave the login empty if you only
want the public tools.

You only do this once. Restart your AI app afterwards; from then on the app starts
the server by itself whenever it needs it, so there is nothing to run after you
restart your computer.

To use it from ChatGPT on the web or your phone, or from Claude on claude.ai or your
phone, the AI service has to reach the server over the internet. See
[Good to know](#good-to-know-chatgpt-and-claude) and the step-by-step guide
[Using it from your phone and the web](docs/remote-access.md).

Updating is one command too: `itu-mcp --update` on a computer, or the same install
command again on Windows or a server. When there is an update, your assistant tells
you with the exact command for your install: once when it is found, then at most
every three days until you update. The server checks GitHub at most once a day, and
`ITU_MCP_UPDATE_CHECK=0` turns that off.

### Good to know: ChatGPT and Claude

The server works with any AI assistant that supports MCP. ChatGPT and Claude
connect to it differently:

| | Installed on your computer | Running on a server |
|:---|---|---|
| **Claude** | Claude Desktop's chat and Claude Code start it themselves. Cowork and claude.ai don't use servers on your computer. | A custom connector with your HTTPS address and API key works on claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Cowork and the phone apps. |
| **ChatGPT** | The desktop app can start local servers (Settings → MCP servers). I haven't tried this yet. | The web and phone apps connect by URL or through OpenAI's Secure MCP Tunnel, which is how I connect to my Pi. |

A server keeps running on its own and also answers while your computer is off. I use
ChatGPT on the web and my phone through Secure MCP Tunnel to my Raspberry Pi, and
Claude Code on my computer.

**The `itu-mcp` package on PyPI and the older upstream packages are not
distributions of this fork.** The [installation guide](docs/installation.md) covers
the server setup, manual installs from source and other clients.

## How it works

```mermaid
graph LR
    client["ChatGPT, Claude or another AI assistant"] <-->|"MCP calls / results"| server["ITU MCP + PaperBridge"]
    server <--> itu["Ninova / OBS / Portal / campus / mail"]
    server <--> pb["PaperBridge"]
    pb <--> metadata["Crossref / Unpaywall"]
    pb <--> publishers["IEEE / Springer / OpenAthens publishers (configured access)"]
    pb <--> archive["Your permitted document archive"]
```

Your assistant calls tools through MCP and receives the results back in its
conversation context. PaperBridge can return paper metadata and retrieved document
text for the assistant to use in its answer or the next research step.

Local clients connect to `itu-mcp` over stdio. Remote clients such as ChatGPT
need `itu-mcp-remote`, your own HTTPS endpoint, authentication and a tool
allowlist. The [advanced settings](docs/advanced.md) and the
[security guide](docs/security.md) explain the setup.

Each installation serves a single user. It does not separate different users or
document archives that share the same server. This repository does not include
credentials, private emails, PDFs, browser sessions or archive databases. Write
actions are on by default; the [advanced settings](docs/advanced.md) show how to switch
each one off. ITU MCP has no official affiliation with ITU.
